### Gameplay
Your goal is to fight the monsters in a randomly generated dungeon. Move into a monster to attack. <br />
Monsters will start off unaware of you, but depending on the result of a stealth check, there is a chance they will notice you. <br />
Monsters who don't yet notice you will have a white background. If you manage to attack an unaware monster, you may be able to make a sneak attack to deal bonus damage.
There are also various potions that you can use to help you. <br />
There is no end goal at the moment, right now, it's just "see how long you can survive." I may consider eventually adding an end goal in the future.
